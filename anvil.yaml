metadata: {title: Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions Using Credit Card, description: 'The
    use of credit cards for online transactions has become increasingly popular, but
    it has also led to a rise in fraudulent activities. To combat this issue, financial
    institutions are turning to advanced technologies such as Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANNs) to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. ANNs are a type of machine
    learning algorithm that can learn and adapt to patterns in data, making them well-suited
    for detecting fraudulent transactions.', logo_img: 'asset:images (7).jpg'}
